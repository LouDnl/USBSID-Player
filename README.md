# USBSID-Player
USBSID-Player aims to be a command line SID file player that is also suited for embedding where both implementations target use with USBSID-Pico. USBSID-Pico is a RPi Pico/PicoW (RP2040) & Pico2/Pico2W (RP2350) based board for interfacing one or two MOS SID chips and/or hardware SID emulators over (WEB)USB with your computer, phone or ASID supporting player.
